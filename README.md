This is my submission for Yanport's Technical Test

Instructions:

1. Please clone the repo from github: https://github.com/kmiguel10/vacuum-technical-test
2. npm install
3. npm run test

I created initial tests for edge cases and the trial 1 from the document. I wanted to use Next.js in order to create a front end visual for the project but I wanted to prioritize the functionality of the project and submit it.
